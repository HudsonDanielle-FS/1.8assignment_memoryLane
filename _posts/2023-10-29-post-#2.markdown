Writing clean code is a fundamental skill that every developer needs. Clean code is easier to maintain and add to later which is important as projects evolve and grow. Clean code reduces bugs and makes troubleshooting errors easier. It also tends to run faster and more efficiently because it avoids unnecessary complexity. Writing meaningful variable and function names can make the code more understandable by describing the variable for function. Functions should be kept short, concise, and focused on a single task. This makes them easier to understand, maintain, and test. Consistent formatting and indentation make the code more organized and easier to read. Refactoring is an important step in writing clean code. Revisiting your code regularly and making improvements, when necessary, will drastically increase the life of your project. Clean code is a continuous journey that will lead to more efficient development practices.
